Yes, you can show Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) on topographical maps using MNE-Python. ERD/ERS refers to changes in power within specific frequency bands, relative to a baseline, typically in response to specific events or stimuli.

To visualize ERD/ERS using topomaps, you generally follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the Data**: Band-pass filter your data to isolate the frequency bands of interest (e.g., alpha, beta, etc.).
2. **Compute Power or Amplitude**: Calculate the power or amplitude of the signal within the frequency band over time.
3. **Define Baseline and Compute ERD/ERS**: Determine a baseline period and compute the percentage change from this baseline to obtain ERD/ERS values.
4. **Plot Topomaps**: Use MNE's plotting functions to visualize the spatial distribution of ERD/ERS over the scalp.

Here is a basic outline of how to perform these steps in MNE-Python:

### 1. Preprocess the Data

First, you filter the data to the frequency band of interest. For example, for alpha (8-12 Hz):

```python
import mne
from mne import io, Epochs, pick_types, combine_evoked
from mne.time_frequency import tfr_multitaper

# Load your raw data
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif('your_raw_file.fif', preload=True)

# Filter for the alpha band (8-12 Hz)
raw.filter(8, 12, fir_design='firwin')
```

### 2. Compute Power or Amplitude

Next, compute the time-frequency representation (TFR) of the data using a method like Morlet wavelets or multitaper:

```python
# Define epochs around the event of interest
events = mne.find_events(raw)
epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=1, tmin=-0.5, tmax=1.5, baseline=None, preload=True)

# Calculate the TFR (power) for the epochs
frequencies = np.linspace(8, 12, 10)  # Alpha frequencies
power = tfr_multitaper(epochs, freqs=frequencies, n_cycles=2, use_fft=True, return_itc=False, average=False)
```

### 3. Define Baseline and Compute ERD/ERS

Calculate the ERD/ERS by comparing the power during the task with a baseline period:

```python
# Define the baseline period (e.g., from -0.5 to 0 seconds)
baseline = (-0.5, 0)

# Compute ERD/ERS: ((Power during task - Baseline power) / Baseline power) * 100
power.apply_baseline(baseline, mode='percent')
```

### 4. Plot Topomaps

Now, you can plot the ERD/ERS using topomaps:

```python
import numpy as np

# Select the time of interest for plotting
times = [0.5]  # 500 ms post-stimulus, for example

# Plot the topomap for a specific frequency band, time point, and baseline-corrected power
power.plot_topomap(baseline=(-0.5, 0), mode='percent', tmin=0, tmax=0.5, fmin=8, fmax=12, time_unit='s')
```

This script shows ERD/ERS topomaps, highlighting areas of synchronization and desynchronization across the scalp in the alpha band. You can adjust the frequency range, time window, and baseline period according to your data and research questions.

### Key Points:
- **ERD (Event-Related Desynchronization)**: A decrease in power relative to baseline, often interpreted as a decrease in neural synchrony or an increase in cognitive effort.
- **ERS (Event-Related Synchronization)**: An increase in power relative to baseline, indicating increased neural synchrony.

These changes can be visualized effectively on topographical maps, showing where on the scalp these effects are most pronounced.
